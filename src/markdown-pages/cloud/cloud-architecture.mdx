# Cloud architecture

Your <GlobalVariable name='cloud'/> Pro architecture supports a maximum of **eight** environments that you can use to develop, test, and launch your store. Each environment contains a database and a web server:

- **Integration**—Provides a single environment branch, and you can create up to four additional, environment branches. This allows for a maximum of five _active_ branches deployed to Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) containers.
- **Staging**—Provides a single environment branch deployed to dedicated Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) containers.
- **Production**—Provides a single environment branch deployed to dedicated Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) containers.
- **Global Master**—Provides a `master` branch deployed to Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) containers.

The following table summarizes the differences between environments:

|                                        | Integration | Staging           | Production           |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Supports settings management in the UI | Yes         | Limited           | Limited              |
| Supports multiple branches             | Yes         | No (Staging only) | No (Production only) |
| Uses YAML files for configuration      | Yes         | No                | No                   |
| Runs on dedicated IaaS hardware        | No          | Yes               | Yes                  |
| Includes Fastly CDN                    | No          | Yes               | Yes                  |
| Includes Blackfire.io                  | Yes         | Yes               | Yes                  |
| Includes New Relic                     | No          | APM               | APM + NRI            |

## Integration environment

Developers use the Integration environment to develop, deploy, and test:

- Magento application code
- Custom code
- Extensions
- Services

The Integration environment runs in a Linux container (LXC) on a grid of servers known as Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). Each environment includes a web server and database to test your site.

<Callout type="info" header="Note">
  The Integration environment does not support all services. For example, the
  Fastly CDN is not accessible in an Integration environment.
</Callout>

### Global Master

The Global Master branch is a part of the Integration environment. You should always push a copy of the Production code to the Global Master in case there is an emergent need to debug the Production environment without interrupting services.

Do **not** create a branch from Global Master. Use the Integration environment branch to create new, active branches.

## Staging environment

The Staging environment provides a near-production environment to test your site. This environment includes all services, such as Fastly CDN, New Relic APM, Blackfire Profiler, and search—and shares the same dedicated IaaS hardware as the Production environment.

You cannot create a branch from the Staging environment branch. You must push code changes from the Integration environment branch to the Staging environment branch.

<Callout type="warning" header="Warning">
  We highly recommend testing every merchant and customer interaction in the
  Staging environment prior to deploying to the Production environment. See
  Deploy your store and Test deployment.
</Callout>

## Production environment

The Production environment runs your public-facing Magento single and multi-site storefronts. This environment runs on dedicated IaaS hardware featuring redundant, high-availability nodes for continuous access and failover protection for your customers. The Production environment includes all services in the Staging environment, plus the [New Relic Infrastructure (NRI)][nri] service, which automatically connects with the application data and performance analytics to provide dynamic server monitoring.

You cannot create a branch from the Production environment branch. You must push code changes from the Staging environment branch to the Production environment branch.

### Redundant hardware

Rather than running a traditional, active-passive master or a master-slave setup, <GlobalVariable name='cloud'/> runs a redundant architecture where all three instances accept reads and writes. This architecture offers zero downtime when scaling and provides guaranteed transactional integrity.

Because of our unique, redundant hardware, we can provide you with three gateway servers. Most external services enable you to whitelist multiple IP addresses, so having more than one fixed IP address is not a problem.

The three gateways map to the three servers in your Production environment cluster and retain static IP addresses. It is fully redundant and highly available at every level:

- DNS
- Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- Elastic load balancer (ELB)
- Three-server cluster comprising all Magento services, including the database and web server

### Backup and disaster recovery

Your Pro plan backup and recovery approach uses a high-availability architecture combined with full-system backups. We replicate each Project—all data, code, and assets—across three separate AWS Availability Zones, each zone with a separate data center.

In addition to the redundancy of the high-availability architecture, <GlobalVariable name='cloud'/> provides
incremental backups, which include the file system and the database, every hour for the last 24 hours of operation. After the
24-hour period, we retain the backups according to the following schedule:

| Time Period    | Backup Retention Policy |
| -------------- | ----------------------- |
| Days 1 to 3    | Each backup             |
| Days 4 to 6    | One backup per day      |
| Weeks 2 to 6   | One backup per week     |
| Weeks 8 to 12  | One bi-weekly backup    |
| Weeks 12 to 22 | One backup per month    |

The <GlobalVariable name="cloud" /> creates the backup using snapshots to encrypted elastic block storage (EBS) volumes. An EBS snapshot is immediate, but the time it takes to write to the simple storage service (S3) depends on the volume of changes.

- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**—is 1 hour for the first 24 hours; after which, the RPO is 6 hours (maximum time to last backup).
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**—depends on the size of the storage. Large EBS volumes take more time to restore.
