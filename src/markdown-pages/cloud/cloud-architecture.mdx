# Cloud architecture

Your <GlobalVariable name='cloud'/> Pro architecture supports a maximum of **eight** environments that you can use to develop, test, and launch your store. Each environment contains a database and a web server:

- **Integration**—Provides a single environment branch, and you can create up to four additional, environment branches. This allows for a maximum of five _active_ branches deployed to Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) containers.
- **Staging**—Provides a single environment branch deployed to dedicated Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) containers.
- **Production**—Provides a single environment branch deployed to dedicated Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) containers.
- **Global Master**—Provides a `master` branch deployed to Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) containers.

The following table summarizes the differences between environments:
