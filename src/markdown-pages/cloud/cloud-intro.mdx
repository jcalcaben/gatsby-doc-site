# Magento Commerce Cloud guide

<GlobalVariable name="cloud" /> is a managed, automated hosting platform for the Magento Commerce software.
<GlobalVariable name="cloud" /> comes with a variety of additional features that sets it apart from the Magento Commerce on-premise and Magento Open Source platforms:

![Cloud Benefits][]

<GlobalVariable name="cloud" /> provides a pre-provisioned infrastructure that includes PHP, MySQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, and Elasticsearch technologies; a git-based workflow with automatic build and deploy for efficient Rapid development and Continuous deployment every time you push code changes in a Platform as a Service (PaaS) environment; highly Customizable environment configuration files and tools; and AWS hosting that offers a Scalable and Secure environment for online sales and retailing.

## Technology stack

Think of the <GlobalVariable name="cloud" /> as five functional layers, as shown here:

![Cloud Stack][]

Amazon Web Services (AWS) powers the underlying Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) for <GlobalVariable name='cloudTool' />. Each <GlobalVariable name="cloud"/> plan provides a PaaS Integration environment for developing, testing, and integrating services. Performance tools provide granular visibility into the site performance and PHP profiling. Fastly caches site assets and, as customers access the site and stores, loads the cached assets fast. The Fastly Image Optimization (IO) offloads image processing and resizing load, freeing servers to process orders and conversions efficiently.

## ece-tools package

The <GlobalVariable name='cloudTool' /> package is a scalable deployment tool that simplifies the Cloud upgrade process. In 2018, we deprecated the `magento-cloud-configuration` and `ece-patches` packages in favor of providing a single package. We encourage all customers to upgrade to use <GlobalVariable name='cloudTool' /> as soon as possible to benefit from the package features, such as commands to create a backup of the database, apply custom patches, and verify environment configuration.
