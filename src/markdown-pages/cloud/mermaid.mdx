# Magento payment provider gateway

You can build useful diagrams to illustrate many types of content using the [mermaid plugin][mermaid]. Consider the following example of a Sequence diagram from the [DevDocs Payment Provider Gateway guide][payment]:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
   participant sales as Sales Management
   participant payment1 as Payment Gateway
   participant payment2 as Payment Processor
   Note over sales: process order

   activate sales
   sales->>payment1: perform action
   activate payment1
   payment1->>payment1: get command
   payment1->>payment2: execute
   activate payment2
   payment2-->>payment1: response
   deactivate payment2
   payment1-->>sales: transaction details
   deactivate payment1
   deactivate sales
```
