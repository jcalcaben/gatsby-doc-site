You can build useful diagrams to illustrate many types of content using the [mermaid plugin][mermaid]. Consider the following example of a Sequence diagram from the [DevDocs Payment Provider Gateway guide][payment]:

## What is Magento payment provider gateway

The Magento payment provider gateway is a mechanism that allows you to integrate your stores with payment service providers. As a result, you can create and handle transactions based on order details.

The following diagram shows a simplified interaction flow between Magento sales management and external payment service provider using Magento payment provider gateway:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
   participant sales as Sales Management
   participant payment1 as Payment Gateway
   participant payment2 as Payment Processor
   Note over sales: process order

   activate sales
   sales->>payment1: perform action
   activate payment1
   payment1->>payment1: get command
   payment1->>payment2: execute
   activate payment2
   payment2-->>payment1: response
   deactivate payment2
   payment1-->>sales: transaction details
   deactivate payment1
   deactivate sales
```

Magento payment provider supports the following payment operations:

- **authorize**: process authorization transaction; funds are blocked on customer account, but not withdrawn
- **sale**: process authorization transaction and capture automatically, funds are withdrawn
- **capture**: withdraw previously authorized amount
- **refund**: return previously withdrawn customer funds
- **void**: cancel transfer of funds from customer account
