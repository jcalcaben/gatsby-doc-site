The new Gatsby Docs site uses MDX to support more interactive documentation that uses JavaScript-based components.

To begin developing documentation for this site, clone the [gatsby-doc-site][site] repository and follow the instructions in the `README.md` file.

Store topic files in the `src/markdown-pages` folder. You can use normal markdown or MDX.
