# Embed topics

You can embed content from other markdown files in your topic. Use the following `import` syntax at the beginning of the topic.

```
import <topic-name> from <path/file-name.mdx>
```

The `topic-name` acts as a variable that you can use to insert the content. The following example imports the `example.mdx` file and inserts the content after the Sample heading:

> Filename: sample.mdx

```
import Example from './example.mdx'

This topic shows how to embed content from another file.

## Sample

<Example />
```
