# Callouts

Callouts are helpful when drawing attention to important information. To add a callout in your topic, use the following syntax:

```
<Callout type="tip" header="Short description or title">
  Place message about a tip here.
</Callout>
```

Sample output:

<Callout type="tip" header="Short description or title">
  Place message about a tip here.
</Callout>

## Tip

<Callout type="tip" header="Good job!">
  This is a tip callout that uses content from another file.
  <Example />
</Callout>

## Info

<Callout type="info" header="Whoah!">
  This feature requires administrative access, so it may prompt you for an
  administrative password at the command line. It does not permanently elevate
  permissions for the dev process but instead, launches a privileged subprocess
  to execute one command.
</Callout>

## Warning

<Callout type="warning" header="Dang!">
  This is a warning callout
</Callout>

## Error

<Callout type="error" header="Oops!">
  These Callouts do not support **markdown**.
  <br />
  They are supposed to be simple message boxes, so should they?
</Callout>
