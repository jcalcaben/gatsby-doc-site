# Navigation

This site's navigation includes a left-side menu, a top bar menu, a footer menu, and a right-side TOC. You can configure these menus using the YML files in the `src/data/pageGroups` directory.

## Table of Contents

The Table of Contents is on the right-hand side of the topic view. This menu provides a list of the current page contents based on the header level.

### Header 3

This TOC does not recognize header size greater than H3. Although an H4 will show in the list, it appears exactly the same as the H3. You can further define this behavior in the CSS file.

## Waffle menu

The waffle menu presents options for a wider documentation selection.
